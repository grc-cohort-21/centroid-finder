     * Returns the euclidean color distance between two hex RGB colors.

     * Each color is represented as a 24-bit integer in the form 0xRRGGBB, where
     * RR is the red component, GG is the green component, and BB is the blue component,

     * The Euclidean color distance is calculated by treating each color as a point
     * in 3D space (red, green, blue) and applying the Euclidean distance formula:
     * 
     * sqrt((r1 - r2)^2 + (g1 - g2)^2 + (b1 - b2)^2)
     * 
     * This gives a measure of how visually different the two colors are.
